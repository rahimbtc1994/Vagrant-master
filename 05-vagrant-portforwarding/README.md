# Share resources between host and guest machines

## Configure port forwarding
Port forwarding lets you access services running on the guest machine directly from the host machine.

## Enable folder synchronization
Folder synchronization creates a shared directory between your host and guest machines, ensuring changes made locally are reflected in the virtual machine in real-time.
